# Living Simple Life

### Documentation

**Design Choices:**
The design of the blog emphasizes simplicity and minimalism, reflecting the core theme of the content. The layout is clean and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices. The color palette is muted, with shades of blue and gray, promoting a calm and focused reading environment. The typography uses a combination of serif and sans-serif fonts to create a balanced and modern look. The navigation is straightforward, with a clear hierarchy and intuitive links to different sections of the blog.

**JavaScript Features:**
The main JavaScript feature implemented is an image slider on the homepage. The slider automatically transitions between images every 5 seconds and includes navigation buttons for manual control. The slider is designed to loop seamlessly by cloning the first and last slides, creating an infinite scroll effect. This enhances user engagement and provides a dynamic visual element to the blog.

**Challenges:**
One challenge was ensuring the slider's smooth transition and infinite loop functionality. This was addressed by cloning slides and adjusting the CSS transitions dynamically. Another challenge was making the layout responsive, which was achieved using CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts.

**Deployment Process:**
The site was deployed using GitHub Pages. The repository was pushed to GitHub, and the GitHub Pages feature was enabled in the repository settings. This provided a live URL for the blog, making it accessible to users.
